Welcome and disclaimer
======================

I am writing this blog to covey the lessons I learned from life in the
hope that it will help other people in their own lives, mostly my
children.

I cover a wide variety of subjects in this blog, but I am not
qualified in way to provide advice on any of those subjects. So I am
not qualified to provide advice on pretty all the topics I am
touching, including (but not limited to):
 - Nutrition
 - Psychology, psychoanalytic, psychiatry, and any other psy-thing
 - Marital counseling
 - Medical advice
 - Mental health
 - Accounting
 - Law
 - Personal finances
 - Investments
 - Tax advice
 - Exercise and sports
 - Pretty much anything else I blog about

You will notice that most of my posts are recipes, but I really didn't
intend this blog to be a collection of recipes. Please feel free to
browse by [categories](categories/) to find non-recipe posts.
