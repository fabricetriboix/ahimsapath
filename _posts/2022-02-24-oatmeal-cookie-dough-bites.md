Tip in a food processor:

 - 1 cup rolled oats
 - 1/2 cup cashew
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract
 - 1 tsp cinnamon
 - 1/2 cup dates
 - 1 tsp soya milk

Blend until smooth, adding soya milk if necessary. Transfer to a bowl
and mix 1/4 cup raisins. Roll into 12 to 15 small balls. It's ready!

You can keep the balls in an airtight container, and put them in the
fridge to let them set.
