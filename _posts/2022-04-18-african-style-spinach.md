Soak 200g of raw peanuts in 400mL of boiling water for about 10'. Do
not drain.

Slice two onions and water-fry them. Add 800g of frozen spinach, 1 1/2
tbsp ground black pepper and salt to taste.

Blend the peanuts with the water and mix with the spinach. Cook on low
heat for about 30' until the spinach is properly cooked.
