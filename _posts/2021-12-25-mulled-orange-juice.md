Very christmassy!

Pour 2L of orange juice in a pot (cartons or fresh if you are
courageous). Add 10 cloves, 4 or 5 cinnamon sticks and 2 tsp ground
mixed spices.

Bring to a boil, then let it simmer for 5-10 minutes. Drink hot. Leave
the cloves and cinnamon sticks in, the more you wait, the more tasty
the mulled juice becomes!
