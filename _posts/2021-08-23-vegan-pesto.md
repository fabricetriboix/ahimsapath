This is a super quick recipe to make a fantastic pesto. You just need
to boil some wholemeal pasta and you have dinner in 15 minutes.

Toast 50g of pine nuts (I usually use the air fryer for 2-3 minutes).
Tip in a smoothie blender and add the following:

 - large bunch of basil
 - 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
 - 2 garlic cloves
 - juice of 1/2 a lemon

Blend until smooth, that's it! It doesn't quite have the same texture
as the real pesto, but it's easy to make and taste delicious.
