There are many Buddha bowl recipes, here is mine.

For the sauce (2 persons), and in a cup or a small bowl:

 - 1 tsp peanut butter
 - 1 tbsp maple syrup (or other healthy sweetener such as agave nectar
   or date syrup)
 - 1 tbsp vinegar
 - 1 tbsp soya sauce

Mix with a teaspoon until smooth.

Cook and drain some brown rice.

Bake some sweet potatoes: pierce them with a fork a few times, and
bake at 180C for 1h. Then cut the sweet potatoes in half and extract
the flesh with a tablespoon.

Cook some chickpeas. I typically cook large batches and store them in
the freezer. You can also use canned chickpeas if you want.

In a bowl, place the following:

 - Brown rice
 - Lettuce
 - Chickpeas
 - Baked sweet potato
 - 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes cut in half
 - 1/2 avocado sliced
 - Some sliced red onion

Add the sauce on top. Nice and healthy, perfect for summer!
