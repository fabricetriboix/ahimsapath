A classic Indian dish. This version is of course super simple and
without any oil.

Dice 4 or 5 medium potatoes and boil them (or steam them).

In a large pot, toast 1 tsp cumin seeds. Then add:

 - A bit of water
 - 1 head garlic, chopped
 - 1 large onion, sliced

Water-fry for about 5', then add:

 - About 1kg frozen spinach
 - 1 tsp turmeric
 - 1 tsp chili powder
 - 1 tsp garam masala
 - 1 tsp coriander powder
 - 1 tsp salt

Cook on medium heat until the spinach is well cooked. Blend the
spinach to make a paste. Add the potatoes to the spinach paste and mix
carefully. Eat with rice or roti.
