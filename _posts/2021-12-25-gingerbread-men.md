The day before, prepare the dough like so: In a large mix bowl, mix 1
tbsp milled flaxseeds and 2.5 tbsp water. Let it rest for 5 minutes.

Then add the following:

 - 3 tbsp molasses
 - 1/2 cup peanut butter
 - 4 tsp ground ginger
 - 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
 - 1/2 tsp baking soda
 - 1/2 cup brown sugar
 - 1/2 cup soya milk (or your favourite non-dairy milk)

Whisk until it becomes a homogeneous paste.

Add 1.5 cup atta flour and mix with a fork. The dough will be quite
sticky. If you press it between your fingers, it should hold its shape
but it should not feel dry. Adjust non-dairy milk or atta flour until
the proper consistency is obtained. Cover the bowl and leave it in the
fridge overnight.

The next day, pre-heat the oven at 175C. Generously cover your worktop
with flour. Put some flour in your hands and take the dough carefully
using a spoon or a spatula. Roll the dough between your hand to make a
ball and cover it with flour. Carefully spread the dough using a
rolling pin. The width should be around 3 to 5 mm. Don't spread it too
thin or the gingerbread men will be too crispy.

Using a cutter or a knife, make some shapes and transfer them to a
baking tray. There will most probably be some dough left, so roll it
again into a ball, spread it with a rolling pin and cut more shapes.

Bake for about 10 minutes, until the edges are becoming brown. Then
take the tray out of the over and let it cool. When cooled down, you
can decorate the gingerbread men.
