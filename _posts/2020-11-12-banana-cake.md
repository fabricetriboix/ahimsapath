Don't let your bananas go to the bin! Here is a great recipe to avoid
throwing those over-ripe bananas.

Pre-heat the over 170C (with fan).

Mash with a fork 5 small very ripe bananas (or 4 big ones, about 350g)
in a big bowl. Add the following:

 - 25g brown sugar (optional, especially if the bananas are well-riped)
 - 125g soya yogurt
 - 180g strong wholemeal flour
 - 2 heaped tsp baking powder
 - 1 tsp cinnamon
 - 1 tsp mixed spices
 - 50g broken pecan nuts (or walnuts if you don't have pecans)

Mix well with a fork and pour in a greased baking tray.

Cook until a plunged knife comes out almost dry (typically 45'-1h).
Then turn off the oven and leave the cake in the oven for a further
20'. The baking is actually quite important to successfully make this
cake.
