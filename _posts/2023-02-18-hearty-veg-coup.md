Ingredients:

1 medium onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
2 cups broccoli chopped
2 medium sweet potatoes, diced
1 large carrot, chopped
2 large tomatoes, chopped
2 teaspoons ginger powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 teaspoons ground turmeric
4 teaspoons paprika
¼ cup nutritional yeast
8 cups water

Instructions:

Wash and prep all the vegetables.
Sauté the onion with 1-2 tablespoons of water until onions are translucent in a large pot. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.
Add the rest of the vegetables and spices to the pan and cook for about 10 minutes. Add 1-2 tablespoons of water at a time, as needed, to keep the vegetables and spices from sticking.
When the carrots and sweet potatoes are soft, add the water. Bring to a boil and cook for about 3-5 minutes, or until reaches desired texture and temperature.
