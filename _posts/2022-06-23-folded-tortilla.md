This definitely goes in the junk food category, but it is quite
delicious!

Heat up a tortilla. Put it in a plate and fold in horizontally and
then vertically. Cut it up from one edge to the centre. Then add some
toppings (see below) on each quarter, fold it three times so it looks
like a quarter of a circle, and air fry it for a couple of minutes.

Toppings for breakfast tortilla:

 - Avocado (diced)
 - Bacon strips (or sausage slices)
 - Tomato (sliced)
 - Grated cheese

Toppings for lunch tortilla:

 - Pepperoni (or sausage slices)
 - Tomato concentrate
 - Olive slices + fresh basil leaves
 - Grated cheese
 - Sprinkle with dried oregano, and top up a bit of tomate concentrate
   on each fold

Toppings for dessert tortilla:

 - Some kind of vegan Nutella
 - Strawberries (sliced)
 - Bananas (sliced)
 - Cream cheese
