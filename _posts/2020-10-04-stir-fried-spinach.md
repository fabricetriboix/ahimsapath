Eating your greens can be a chore, but this delicious recipe makes it
a lot easier.

In a pan, toast 1 tsp of jeera (cumin seeds) and 4 dried red chillies
for a couple of minutes. Then add 1 chopped onion and 1 garlic head
(minced or crushed). Cook for 10'.

Add:

 - Either one chopped tomato, or 1/3 tin of chopped tomato
 - 500g fresh spinach
 - 2 tsp ginger-garlic paste
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp ground jeera (cumin seeds)
 - 1 tsp chili powder
 - 1/2 tsp turmeric

Cook on low-medium heat until the spinach is cooked (about 15').

Eat with brown rice of chapati. Can also be used as a side-dish.
