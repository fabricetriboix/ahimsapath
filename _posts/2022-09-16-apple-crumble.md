A delicious and semi-healthy crumble recipe. You can use other fruits
than apples. I use mostly peanut butter instead of butter or
shortening. The issue is that it's difficult to quantify exactly how
much you need because it depends on how thick or oily your peanut
butter is. So please take the quantities as approximative only. Also,
it's really hard to do a nice crumble dough with only peanut butter,
so I do add a bit of coconut oil.

Pre-heat the oven at 175C with fan.

In a big bowl, put the following:

 - 1 cup atta flour
 - 2/3 cup peanut butter
 - 1 or 2 tsp coconut oil
 - 1/4 cup brown sugar

Work with your hands until you obtain a crumbly dough that sticks
together when you squeeze it in your hand, but still crumble easily.
Add flour or peanut butter/coconut oil as required.

Dice about 6-8 medium apples and place inside a baking dish. Add a bit
of water (this is because apples don't give a lot of water, if you use
fruits with a lot of water inside them, such as plums, skip this
stae). Sprinkle 1 tsp cinnamon and some additional brown sugar if the
apples you used are sour. Top-up with the crumble dough and bake for
about 45'.
