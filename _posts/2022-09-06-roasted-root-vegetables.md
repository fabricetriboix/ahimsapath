Really and easy recipe. Pre-heat the oven 180C.

Oil a baking tray with a bit of olive oil, then add:

 - Some beetroots, cut in big chunks
 - Some potatoes, cut in big chunks
 - Some carrots, cut in big chunks
 - A few medium onions, unpeeled (but washed)
 - Cloves of a garlic head, unpeeled (but washed)
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp ground black pepper
 - 1 tsp thyme

Bake for 1.5h, shaking the tray from time to time.

Then remove the veggies from the tray and put aside. Pour 50 mL of
water into the tray and leave it for 5' to deglaze. Then pour into a
small pot and add:

 - 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
 - 1 tpsb tahini

Bring to a boil, then simmer for a few minutes to reduce a little bit.
And there is your gravy for the veggies!
