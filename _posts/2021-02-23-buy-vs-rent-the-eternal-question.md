Should you own your accommodation, or should you rent? Most people
have the intuitive notion that owning your accommodation is better
financially. I wanted to explore this idea, so I created a spreadsheet
comparing buying vs renting over a long period of time. I wanted to
take into account all aspects of renting vs all aspects of owning in
order to provide a true picture of what could be your financial
position in a number of years ahead. I computed 40 years, assuming you
leave your parent's home at 25 and retire at 65.

Here are some notes about the spreadsheet to help you understand it:

 - I used the rental value and property value of a mid-range
   accommodation in the area I live.
 - The spreadsheet does not show inflation, but indirectly takes it
   into account as all the rates are given with inflation removed; for
   example, if you expect a diversified portfolio to return 7% per
   year and the inflation rate is 2%, the real rate of return is 5%
   and this is what I entered into the spreadsheet.
 - Buying means that you need to put down a deposit; so to have a fair
   comparison, I assumed that the "rent" option would take that money
   and invest it into a diversified portfolio.
 - Whatever difference there is between monthly rent and monthly
   mortgage payment is invested in a diversified portfolio.
 - I assumed you would remortgage every 5 years.
 - I assumed you would move accommodation every 10 years for a
   property of similar value.

The conclusion, at least with the numbers I punched in, is that
renting or owning result in approximately the same amount of wealth
after 40 years. This actually depends a lot on the rental yield. If
the rental yield is high, owning is much better. If it is low, renting
puts you in a better position.

Overall, I still do believe that owning your accommodation is
preferable, if only for the fact that you have more control over the
property. When you rent, the landlord will usually put so many
restrictions you can't even hang a picture on the wall. Also, people
sometimes downsize in their later years, and the release equity will
typically provide a better return because it can be invested in a
diversified portfolio compared to the usual increase in accommodation
value. The other advantage of owning is that you have no choice but to
pay the mortgage. If you rent, you have to have enough discipline to
invest the surplus instead of spending it or falling for lifestyle
inflation, which is much harder to do and will require a lot of
willpower from you.

On the other hand, renting is more flexible and allows to you move to
another place or country easily.

it a try.
