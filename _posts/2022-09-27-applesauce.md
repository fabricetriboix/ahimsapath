You will need about 3kg of apples. Clean the apples.

In a bowl, put 2 tbsp lemon juice and 1 cup of water. Then dice one
apple and put the apple chunks in the bowl. This will prevent them
from oxidising and turning brown. Then put the chunks in a big pot.
Repeat until you did all the apples. Then add the following in the
pot:

  - The rest of the lemon and water mix
  - 1/2 cup brown sugar
  - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
  - 1 tsp ground nutmeg

Cook on low heat. I use low heat right from the beginning so nothing
will burn at the bottom of the pot. Cook until the mix becomes a bit
thick (about 1h). You might need to use a potato masher to mash the
apples a little bit. Then transfer to sterilised jars, close the lids
and turn the jars upside down while the mixture is still boiling (a
good tip to kill any germs and prevent future mold). While you
transfer the jam to the jars, keep the mixture under low heat so it
stays fluid.
