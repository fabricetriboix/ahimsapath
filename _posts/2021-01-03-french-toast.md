A delicious semi-healthy variation of this classic recipe.

In a large bowl, whisk the following:

 - 1 cup soy milk
 - 1/4 cup wholemeal flour (I use atta flour)
 - 1 tbsp nutritional yeast flakes
 - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract
 - 2 tsp maple syrup (or some other healthy sweetener)

Use 4 to 6 very thick slices of some wholemeal bread. You can use
stale bread if you want, but I prefer fresh bread because the French
toasts will be more mellow. Dip a slice in the batter, one side and
then the other. Cook in a lightly oiled pan, about 5 minutes each
side. Repeat for all the bread slices.

You can add some topping if you want, I think they just taste great
even without toppings!
