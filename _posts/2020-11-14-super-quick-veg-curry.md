The hardest part of this curry is to cut the onion and garlic!

Cut an onion and a garlic head and water-fry them on medium heat. When
the onion become translucent (about 5-10'), add the following:

 - One tin of tomatoes (about 400g)
 - A few green chillis (sliced)
 - 2 tsp ginger garlic paste
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp turmeric
 - 1 tsp paprika
 - 1 tsp cumin powder
 - 1 tsp chili powder
 - 2 tsp mild Madras curry powder
 - 3 tsp peanut butter (as much as a tsp can hold, so that's quite a lot of peanut butter!)

Let it simmer for 5', then add a variety of frozen vegetables. I
typically put the following:

 - 2 cups green beans
 - 1 cup edamame beans
 - 1 cup peas
 - 2 cups vegetable mix
 - 1 cup sweetcorn

Eat with brown rice or chapati. Super easy, healthy and delicious!
