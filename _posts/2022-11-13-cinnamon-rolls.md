This is a really nice recipe for some healthy and delicious cinnamon
rolls.

In a dough mixing bowl (or like me, use a programmable bread machine),
add the following:

 - 1 cup soya milk
 - 5 tbsp peanut butter
 - 4 tbsp brown sugar
 - 2 tsp bread yeast
 - 5 tbsp vital wheat gluten
 - 2 cups atta flour

Mix everything, and adjust the soya milk or atta flour depending on
the consistency. The dough should be quite sticky, but not liquid.

Let the dough rise near a source of heat until it doubled in size.

When the dough has double in size, it's time to get back to the
kitchen. Pre-heat the oven at 170C with fan, and grease a baking tray.

Sprinkle some atta flour on your worktop. Carefully pick the dough
ball and sprinkle some flour on it too, then put on the floured
worktop. Put some flour on a rolling pin and roll out the dough in a
rectangle shape about 1/4 inch thickness.

Put some peanut butter in a small bowl and microwave it a little bit
to soften it. Brush the peanut butter on top of the dough. Sprinkle
some ground cinnamon and then some brown sugar.

Roll the dough and put the seam down. Cut the log with a serrated
knife, about 1.5 inch apart. Place the cinnamon rolls in the baking
tray and bake for 25 minutes. 

Then remove from the oven, cover with a tea towel and let it cool
before eating. Enjoy!
