This is a good recipe to eat your daily ration of turmeric. Golden
milk is used in Ayurveda and is packed with anti-oxidant and is a
fantastic anti-inflammatory beverage.

Put some soya milk in one cup. Add 1/2 tsp of ground turmeric, 1/2 tsp
of ground cinnamon and a pinch of ground black pepper.

Mix well with 1 tsp of date syrup (I use a coffee stirrer). If you
don't have date syrup, use any other healthy sweetener (maple syrup,
molasses or unrefined sugar).

Pop in the microwave for a minute or so (depending on how powerful
your microwave is).
