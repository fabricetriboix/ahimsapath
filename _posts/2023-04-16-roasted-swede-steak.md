It doesn't taste like steak at all, but really tastes amazing. It's
the best way I know to cook swede.

Pre-heat the oven at 160C (with fan).

Peel the swede and cut it in large slices, about half inch thick.

In a large bowl, mix the following:

 - Maple syrup, about 1/4 cup
 - 1/2 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp steak seasoning

Mix well. Spread the mixture on both sides of each swede slice. Put
the slices on a baking mat and bake for 1h. Turn the slices
mid-baking.
