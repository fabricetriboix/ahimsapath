A vegan version of the classic. A good way to avoid throwing some
stale bread away.

Mix in a large bowl:

 - 3 cup soya milk
 - 3/4 cup brown sugar
 - 1/2 cup ground flax seeds
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract
 - 1 tsp ground cinnamon

Add 1 lbs (450g) of stale bread and mix well. Leave aside for 1h and
mix more. To make it more interesting, I usually add some top-ups.
Typically, I add some dark chocolate chips, some chopped orange rinds
and a couple of handfuls of walnuts.

Bake in oven 180C (with fan) for ~1h.
