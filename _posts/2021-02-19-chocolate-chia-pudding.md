In a bowl, add the following:

 - 2 tbsp cocoa powder
 - 2 tbsp maple syrup
 - 1 tsp cinnamon
 - 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Whisk to make a paste. Then progressively add 1 cup of soya milk. Add
1/2 cup chia seeds and whisk again. Cover with cling film and
refrigerate overnight. I usually also need to whisk the pudding before
eating it.
