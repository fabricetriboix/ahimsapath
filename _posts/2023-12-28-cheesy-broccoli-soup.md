The day before, put some cannellini beans to soak. The next day, cook
them in the pressure cooker. If you don't have cannellini beans, red
kidney beans are fine.

Put 3/4 cup cashew nuts in a bowl and add boiling water. Drain after 30'.

Put in a large pot:
 - 2 onions, diced
 - 1 garlic head, chopped
 - 2 cups vegetable broth
 - 1 celery rib, chopped (optional)

Bring to boil, then let simmer for 5 minutes. Transfer to a blender
and mix until smooth and transfer back into the pot. Alternatively use
a plunging blender. Then add 4 cups vegetable broth and bring to a
boil (if you don't have vegetable broth, add 4 cups of water and 2
cubes).

Then add 6 cups broccoli florets and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the
broccoli has just softened; do not overcook.

Tip in a blender:

 - 1/4 cup rolled oats
 - 1 cup cannellini beans, cooked
 - the drained cashew nuts
 - 1 tsp ground turmeric
 - 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
 - 1 tsp smoked paprika
 - 1 tsp ground black pepper
 - 1 tsp chili powder
 - salt to taste (1 tsp should be enough)
 - 2 cups of soup mixture

Process until smooth and mix back with the soup. Bring to a boil
again and turn off the heat.

Serve into bowls and garnish each bowl with 2 tsp nutritional yeast
each and, optionally, 1/2 tsp chili flakes.
