This is a recipe I perfected over time for my fussy-eating son. He
loves those muffins and they are super-healthy! Actually, me too I
can't stop eating them!

Soak in a large bowl for at least 15':

 - 1 cup raisins
 - 4 tsp goji berries
 - 1/4 cup brown sugar
 - 2 cups soya milk

Pre heat oven 175C (with fan).

Then add:

 - 4 cups oat
 - 2 tsp ground cinnamon
 - 1 tbsp baking powder
 - 2 tsp vanilla extract
 - 2 large bananas, mashed
 - 1/2 cup peanut butter, smooth or crunchy
 - 3 tbsp ground flaxseeds

Mix well with a fork.

Put in cupcakes moulds and bake for 20'
