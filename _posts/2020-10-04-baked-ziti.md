Wonderful comfort food from the Mediterranean! Super easy and
delicious!

First of all, soak 4 tbsp of cashews in how water.

Pre-heat the oven 180C (with fan).

Half cook 500g of wholemeal pasta (I usually use fusilli).

In the meanwhile, in a big pot, water fry one chopped onion and one
garlic head minced or crushed (I love garlic, but you can put less if
that's your taste).

After about 10', add

 - 2 tins of diced tomatoes
 - 6 tbsp of green olives
 - 1 tsp oregano
 - 1 tsp provence herbs
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp pepper

Cook for 10 more minutes. Take out of the stove and mix with the
pasta.

In the meanwhile, prepare the no-cheese sauce. Put in a smoothie blender:

 - 1 onion
 - the drained cashew nuts
 - 1 cup nutritional yeast
 - 1/2 cup water
 - 1/2 tsp salt
 - 1/2 tsp paprika
 - 1/2 tsp chili powder
 - 1/2 turmeric powder

Mix in the blender until smooth.

Take out a large baking dish and spread evenly the mix of pasta and
sauce. Top up with no-cheese sauce. Bake at 180C (with fan) for 25
minutes.
