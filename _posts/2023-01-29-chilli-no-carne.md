Mexican classic, vegan version.

Soak one cup of red kidney beans overnight. Cook then in the pressure
cooker the next day, typically for 7 minutes.

Dice 2 onions and 1 garlic head and water fry for a few minutes.

Then add:

 - 2 tins of chopped tomatoes
 - 2 tsp smoked paprika
 - 2 tsp chilli powder
 - 3 finely sliced green chilis
 - 2 tsp salt
 - 3 chopped red peppers
 - 2 diced carrots
 - 2 celery stalks, sliced
 - 50g-100g soya mince

Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer until the
veggies are cooked to your taste. Finally, add the cooked beans and
let it simmer for a few minutes until the beans are hot.
