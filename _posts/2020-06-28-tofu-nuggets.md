This is a semi-healthy vegan replacement for chicken nuggets.

Use an extra-firm block of tofu (usually around 440g). Wrap in a tea
towel and press with a heavy pan for 30 minutes. Put back in its
packaging, wrap with parchment paper and freeze overnight (or at least
6h); this will give the tofu a meatier texture. The next morning,
defrost at room temperature for a few hours, or in the microwave. Wrap
in a tea towel and press with a heavy pan again for another 30
minutes. Then break the tofu down with your hands in nugget-size
pieces (about 1/2 inch size).

In a big bowl, mix the following:
 - 1 tbsp soy sauce
 - 1/2 tbsp nutritional yeast
 - 1 tsp garlic powder
 - 1 tsp hot sauce (or sriracha sauce)
 - 1/4 cup soy milk
 - 3/4 tsp apple cider vinegar (or balsamic vinegar)

Then add the tofu pieces and mix well. Marinate for 30 to 60 minutes.
Mix from time to time.

Take three bowls.

In the first bowl, mix the following:
 - 1 tbsp all-purpose flour
 - 1/2 tbsp corn starch

In the second bowl, mix the following:
 - 1/4 cup soy milk
 - 3/4 tsp apple cider vinegar (or balsamic vinegar)

In the third bowl, mix the following:
 - 1/3 cup breadcrumbs
 - 1/2 tbsp nutritional yeast
 - 1 tsp garlic granules
 - 1 tsp onion granules
 - 1 tsp paprika
 - 1 tsp ground pepper
 - 1/2 tsp chili powder

Take the tofu pieces one by one and dip them in the first bowl, then
the second and then the third.

To cook the nuggets, you can deep fry them or bake them. I cook them
in an air fryer at 180C for 10 minutes.
