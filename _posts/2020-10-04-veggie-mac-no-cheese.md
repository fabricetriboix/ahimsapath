This is a delicious recipe that will make anyone eat their veg!

Cook 500g of whole grain pasta and put aside.

Water fry 1 chopped onion and 1 garlic head (minced or crushed). After
10', add:

 - 200g of chopped kale
 - 200g of chopped broccoli (or 1 head)
 - 1 tin of diced tomatoes

Cook on low-medium heat until the vegetables are cooked.

In the meanwhile, prepare the no-cheese sauce. In a smoothie blender,
add:

 - 1 cup cashew nuts
 - 1/2 cup nutritional yeast
 - 1/2 cup water
 - 1 tsp ground turmeric
 - 1 tsp paprika
 - 1 tsp chili powder
 - 1 tsp garlic powder
 - 1 onion
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp black pepper

Blend until smooth.

**Important note**: If you intend to keep this dish overnight and eat
the leftovers the next day, I would advise to not add the nutritional
yeast in the blend, and rather to sprinkle some nutritional yeast when
you serve the dish. The reason is that I noticed this dish takes a
different, quite yucky, taste after spending some time in the fridge.

Mix pasta, veggies and sauce, and cook for another 2'. Yummy!
