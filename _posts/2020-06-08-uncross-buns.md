Here is a vegan recipe for hot cross buns, but I am too lazy to make
the cross at the top, so I called them "uncross buns". As usual, I am
trying to find the fastest and easiest way to make a recipe that is
healthy and tastes nice.

I am using a dough mixer for this recipe. If you don't have one, you
can use your own hands.

In a dough mixer bowl, add the following ingredients (in that order):

 - 1 tbsp raw sugar (I use brown sugar or molasses)
 - 1/2 cup raisins
 - 1/4 cup currants
 - 1/4 cup mixed peels or orange rind
 - 1 1/5 cup soya milk
 - Soak for a while (15-20 minutes), then add:
 - a mashed banana
 - 150g wholemeal bakers (strong) flour - also know as bread flour
 - 175g wholemeal spelt flour
 - 1 tbsp baking powder
 - 1 tsp cinnamon
 - 1 tsp mixed spices
 - 1/4 tsp ground cloves

Knead on lowest setting for 8-10 minutes or until the dough looks
elastic.

Pre-heat the oven 180C with fan.

Divide into 12 buns (I use silicone baking moulds) and bake for 15
minutes.

Wow! That was easy. And everything is dishwasher safe, so little work
for you overall.

If you do want to make the crosses, mix a bit of white flour with some
orange juice until it makes a paste. Put that in a piper and make some
crosses mid-cooking.
