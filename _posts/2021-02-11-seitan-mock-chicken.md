If you are worried about eating too much processed mock meat, here is
a recipe to make your own!

Blend in food processor:

 - 3/4 cup cooked chickpeas
 - 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
 - 1 tsp garlic powder
 - 1 tsp onion powder
 - 1/2 tsp dried thyme
 - 1/4 tsp coriander powder
 - 1/2 tsp dried sage
 - 1/2 tsp turmeric
 - 1/2 tsp chili powder
 - 1/2 tsp paprika
 - 1 tbsp dijon mustard
 - 1 1/2 cup vegetable stock

Process until well mixed.

Pour into mixing bowl and add 1.5 cup vital wheat gluten. Knead, but
not too much. You just want it to go from soft and sticky to just
starting to become firm.

Flatten on a chopping board, cut in 4 pieces, then cut each piece into
2 lengthwise. Cook in a steamer for about 20 minutes. You can then
further cook in oven 200C for 10 minutes; just be careful because
those patties tend to become dry quickly.
