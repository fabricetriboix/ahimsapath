Cook 500g of wholemeal spaghetti and put aside. Slice or chop a
variety of vegetables, whatever you have at hand. For example:

 - Some dark green leafy veg, such as spinach or spring greens
 - Mushrooms
 - Spring onions
 - Capsicum
 - Water chestnuts
 - Broccoli

Fry one onion (sliced) and 1 head of garlic (sliced) into 2 tbsp
toasted sesame oil for 2 minutes in a large pot. Then add the veggies
in order of cooking time. I usally add the mushrooms and capsicum
first, and leaves and broccoli after a couple of minutes.

After you added the last set of veggies, add:

 - 4 tbsp soya sauce
 - 1-2 tsp sechuan pepper
 - 2 tsp chili flakes

Cook for about 10 minutes until the veggies are cooked. Then add 2
tbsp toasted sesame seeds. Mix in with the spaghetti and you're done!
