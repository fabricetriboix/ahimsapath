This is a super easy and delicious recipe, but you do need a waffle
maker.

In a large bowl, put the following:

 - 2 cups atta flour
 - 2 cups soya milk
 - 2 tsp baking powder
 - 3 tbsp brown sugar
 - 2 tbsp applesauce
 - spices of your choice: 2 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp cinnamon,
   anything you like

Whisk and try to remove lumps (a bit of lumps is OK).

Heat up your waffle maker. Spray a tiny bit of oil on the plates, put
some batter and close the lid. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes. In any case,
follow the waffle maker's instructions.

Serve immediately and top up with whatever you fancy, such as maple
syrup, chopped bananas, melted chocolate, etc.
