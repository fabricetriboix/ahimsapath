Pre-heat the oven 180C (with fan).

Put in the bowl of a dough mixer:

 - 1 1/2 cup soya milk
 - 320g atta flour
 - 2 tbsp vital wheat gluten
 - 1 tbsp baking powder
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1 handful grated vegan cheese
 - 1/2 cup olives

Mix well on a low setting. Adjust the soya milk or the flour so that
the consistency is either a thick batter or a sticky dough.

Divide into 12 buns (I use silicone baking moulds) and bake for 15
minutes.
