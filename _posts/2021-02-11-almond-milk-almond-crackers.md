Two recipes in one and no waste! If you like making your own almond
milk, don't throw away the almond meal, you can use it to make some
delicious crackers.

Soak 1/2 cup of almonds overnight. The next day, blend with 2 cups
water and 6 pitted dates. Pour in a coffee strainer and squeeze with
your hands to extract the milk.

Now you have your almond milk. Don't throw away the almond meal!

Put in a large bowl:

 - Almond meal (i.e. what's in the coffee strainer)
 - 1 cup wholemeal flour
 - 2 tsp garlic powder
 - 1 tsp oregano
 - 1 tsp thyme
 - 1 tsp rosemary

Flatten with pin roll on a baking sheet. Cut squares and bake at 180C
for about 1h.
