Really nice side dish for the
[vegan wellington]({% post_url 2021-12-25-vegan-wellington %}). Enough
for 4-6 people.

Pre-heat the oven to 180C with fan (200C without fan).

In a large bowl, mix the following:

 - 1.5 tbsp tahini
 - 1.5 tbsp warm water
 - 1.5 tbsp nutritional yeast
 - 1 tsp lemon juice
 - 1 tsp paprika
 - 1 tsp garlic powder
 - 1/2 tsp salt

Then add 2 cups of Brussels sprouts and 2 cups of baby potatoes. Mix
until they are all covered with the mixture. Transfer to an oiled
baking tray. Bake for 30 minutes. Then give the baking tray a good
shake and cook for 30 more minutes. Serve hot.
