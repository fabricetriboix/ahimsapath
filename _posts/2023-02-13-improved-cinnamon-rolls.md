A vegan and healthy adaptation of the classic. These cinnamon rolls
are really tasty and super healthy.

In a dough maker, put the following (and in that order):

 - 450mL soya milk
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 2 tsp yeast
 - 2 tsp vanilla extract
 - 500g atta flour
 - 3 tbsp vital wheat gluten
 - 3 tbsp brown sugar

The additional gluten is necessary because atta flour is not strong
enough. It will make the dough more elastic and less of a brick.
Please also note that the salt is kind of necessary to get the yeast
to properly work. Run the dough maker on low speed until the dough is
properly kneaded (about 4-5 minutes).

Transfer the dough ball into a slightly greased large bowl, cover with
cling film and let the dough rise. This will take a few hours,
depending on many factors.

When the dough has doubled in size, carefully take the dough ball out
on a floured surface and spread it in a rectangle with a pin roller.

Optional step: Put 2 tbsp of peanut butter in a small bowl. Heat it up
in the microwave for 30 seconds to make it easier to spead. Brush a
thin layer of peanut butter on top of the dough rectangle. This step
is optional, the cinnamon rolls will still be very nice without it.

Mix 4 tbsp brown sugar with 4 tsp cinnamon powder. Sprinkly evenly and
generously sprinkle this mixture on top of the dough rectangle.

Then carefully roll the dough in a log. Cut the buns using a serrated
knife and place in a baking tray lined with some baking paper. Again,
cover with cling film and let the buns rise for 1 or 2h.

Pre-heat the oven at 160C (with fan) and bake the buns in the
following way:
 - Bake for 8 minutes
 - Then turn the tray and bake for another 8 minutes
 - Then remove the tray from the oven and turn the buns upside down
   and bake for 4 minutes
 - Then turn the tray and bake for another 4 minutes

The idea is to ensure even baking for all parts of the buns. You might
need to experiement with what works best for your oven.
