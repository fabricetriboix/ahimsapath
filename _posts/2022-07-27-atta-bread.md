This is a bread recipe that is using atta flour rather than the usual
strong wholemeal flour. There are reasons to use atta flour, mostly
because it's more finely ground, and also it's cheaper!

This recipe is written with the Sana bread maker in mind, but you
should be able to adapt it to other bread makers, or even just by hand
if that's your thing.

In the bucket, put the following (and in that order):

 - 420mL water
 - 2 tsp salt
 - 3 tsp yeast
 - 500g atta flour
 - 3 tbsp vital wheat gluten

Please note that the amount of water depends on the atta flour. Some
need a lot of water, some little. You will need to do some experiment.

The additional gluten is necessary because atta flour is not strong
enough. It will make the bread more elastic and less of a brick.

You can top up with some additional ingredients if you wish. I usually
add 1 tbsp sunflower seeds and 1 tbsp pumpkin seeds, but you could
anything walnuts or anything you fancy.

Program the Sana bread maker like so:

 - Knead for 3 minutes and maximum power
 - Dough rise at 30C for 1h30'
 - Bake for 1h at 150C
 - Bake for 20' at 180C
