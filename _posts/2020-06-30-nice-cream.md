Healthy alternative to ice cream.

Process in a food processor:
 - 4 medium bananas or 3.5 large bananas (the bananas should be well riped)
 - 200g frozen strawberries
 - 2 tsp vanilla extract
 - 4 tsp peanut butter (very full tea spoons)
 - 1 or 2 tbsp date syrup, depending on how ripe the bananas are; you
   can use some other sweetener if you don't have date syrup, such as
   maple syrup

Pour in lollipop moulds and freeze overnight.

When you want to eat it, take a lollipop out of the freezer and plunge
it in hot water for about 10 seconds and you should be able to take it
out.
