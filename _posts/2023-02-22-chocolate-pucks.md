This is absolutely delicious and very healthy!

Tip in a food processor:

 - 80g rolled oats
 - 100g walnuts
 - 15g cocoa powder

Blend until finely chopped.

Then add 150g pitted dates and blend again.

Transfer to a large bowl, add 2 tbsp honey or maple syrup and mix
well. Form into hockey pucks.

Melt 150g of dark chocolate and dip the pucks into it. Refrigerate for
about 1h. Done!
