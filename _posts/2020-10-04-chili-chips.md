This is a nice Nepali recipe, very easy to do and fairly quick.

Cut 4 potatoes in big chips and air fry.

Cut the veggies before cooking:

 - 1 large onion coarsely cut (essentially, just cut it in four)
 - 2 green chilis, sliced
 - 2 small capsicums coarsely cut
 - 4 small tomatoes, cut in 4

Water fry garlic and ginger for 2 minutes on high heat, stirring constantly.

Add the onion and cook for 2 more minutes.

Then add the chilis, capsicum, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp chili powder and cook
for 2 more minutes.

Then add 1 tbsp ketchup and the chips, and cook for 2 more minutes.

Then add the tomatoes and cook for 1 more minute.

Turn the heat off and serve quickly.

You can replace the chips by steamed momos to make chili momo, which
is really nice too!
