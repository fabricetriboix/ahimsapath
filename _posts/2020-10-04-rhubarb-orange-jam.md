This is my own semi-healthy recipe for this delicious jam.

You will need:

 - Around 600g rhubarb
 - Two oranges
 - One handful of raisins
 - Around 400g brown sugar
 - 1 tsp cinnamon

Press the oranges and keep the juice. Remove the flesh from
the orange peels. Shred the orange peels in a food processor with a
bit of water or cut them by hand.

Peel the rhubarb of the hardest skin parts and slice it.

Put everything in a large pot and cook on low heat. I use low heat
right from the beginning so nothing will burn at the bottom of the
pot. Cook until the mix becomes a bit thick (about 1-2h). Transfer to
sterilised jars, close the lids and turn the jars upside down while
the mixture is still boiling (a good tip to kill any germs and prevent
future mold). While you transfer the jam to the jars, keep the mixture
under low heat so it stays fluid.
