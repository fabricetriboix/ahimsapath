A stray cat started visiting us, so I searched online what kind of food I could
prepare for him that was at least semi-nutritious. He eats it, although I don't
think he relishes in it... Interestingly, it's a perfect snack for humans too!

Cook 1 cup of lentils. Drain and let it cool down.

Pre-heat the oven at 180C with fan.

Tip into a food processor:

  - The cooked, drained lentils
  - 1/8 cup oil
  - 2 cups atta flour (or plain whole meal flour)
  - 1 tsp salt

Process until it makes a paste. It doesn't have to be completely blended.

Make some balls with your hands and put them on a baking sheet. Bake 10
minutes, then rotate the tray horizontally and bake for 10 more minutes.

Let it completely cool down before giving to the cat, they don't like hot food
at all.
