Mexican food with a Mediterranean and South Asian touch.

Heat up the tortilla, then spread on each:

 - Some hummus
 - Ground turmeric
 - Smoked paprika
 - Thyme
 - Avocado
 - Red onion
 - Bell pepper (capsicum)
 - Beans (black beans, pinto beans, chickpeas, whatever you have at hand)
 - Sweetcorn
 - Sliced green chili (skip this if you don't like spicy food)
 - Lettuce

Wrap and eat!
