Pre-heat the oven at 180C (with fan).

Mix in a large bowl:

 - 4 cups rolled oats
 - 1 tbsp baking powder
 - 2 tsp vanilla extract
 - 3 tbsp ground flaxseeds
 - 1/2 cup brown sugar
 - 2/3 cup cocoa powder
 - 2 cups soya milk

Mix well. Put aside for 10 minutes, time for the oats and the
ground flaxseeds to absord the liquid. The mixture should have the
consistency of a thick batter.

Mix in 200g chcoloate chips and pour the batter into cupcake moulds.

Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the tray and bake for another 10
minutes.

Let the muffins cool down before removing them from the moulds.
