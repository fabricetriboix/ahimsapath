A tasty recipe from the Mediterranean which will help you eat your
dark green leafy vegetables!

Cook 2 cups of brown rice.

Preheat the oven at 180C (with fan).

Water-fry one garlic head (about 5' medium heat), then add 1kg of
frozen chopped spinach. Then add:

 - 1 tsp dried basil
 - 1 tsp chili flakes
 - 1/2 tsp oregano
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp ground pepper

Cook on medium heat until the spinach is cooked. Add water as
necessary, but usually that's not needed.

In the meanwhile, prepare the no-cheese sauce. Put in a smoothie
blender:

 - 1 onion
 - 4 tbsp cashew nuts
 - 1 cup nutritional yeast
 - 2/3 cup water
 - 1/2 tsp salt
 - 1/2 tsp paprika
 - 1/2 tsp chili powder
 - 1/2 turmeric powder

Mix in the blender until smooth.

When the spinach is cooked, add the cooked rice and the no-cheese
sauce. Mix well.

Take 6 capsicums and cut them in half. Clean the halves and put them
on a baking dish or a baking tray. Stuff the capsicum halves with the
mixture and cook in the oven for 30' (or 20' if you like them
crunchy).
