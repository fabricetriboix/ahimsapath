I like mexican food, and this stew is wonderful! On top of that, it's
very easy to prepare a large quantity in no time.

The day before, soak one cup of dry corn (I usually use corn for
popcorn) and 2 cups of dry beans (typically red kidney beans).

Put the corn and beans in a pressure cooker and cook for 15 minutes.

In the meanwhile, water fry 1 chopped onion and 1 garlic head (minced
or crushed). After 5-10', add:

 - 2 tins of diced tomatoes
 - 1/2 cup of sliced green chili
 - 3 tsp smoked paprika
 - 2 tsp chili powder
 - 1 tsp provence herbs
 - 1 tsp oregano
 - 2 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp turmeric

Let it simmer for 15' until the tomato is cooked. Then mix with the
corn and beans. Eat with brown rice, or like me: chapatis (interesting
cultural mix!)
