A nice, different way to eat your apples. In a pot, put:

 - 4 to 6 medium-sized apples, diced
 - 1 tsp cinnamon
 - 1 handful raisins
 - 1 handful prunes
 - 1 handful almonds
 - Add water until it covers the apples

Then:

 - Cover with a lid
 - Bring to a boil
 - Let it simmer for 5'
 - Turn off the hob (it will finish cooking while cooling down)
