This is a very easy recipe to produce a large (and delicious) quantity
of food quickly with minimal effort.

Pre-heat the oven at 210C (with fan).

Put 2 cups soya milk and tbsp apple cider vinegar into a large bowl
and put aside for 2 minutes. This will make some kind of buttermilk.

Then add the following into the bowl:

 - 2.25 cups atta flour
 - 1.5 tbsp baking powder
 - 1 tsp baking soda
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 3-6 tbsp brown sugar
 - 1 tbsp vanilla extract
 - 1/3 cup applesauce

Mix for about 1 minutes (don't overmix).

Put some baking paper on a baking tray and pour the batter into it.
Top up with ingredients of your choice, for example:

 - chocolate chips
 - strawberries
 - blueberries

Bake for about 30 minutes. Rotate mid-baking. Test with a toothpick
from time to time.
