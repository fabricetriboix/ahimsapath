I love this soup!

Soak 1 cup butter beans overnight. Cook the beans: 15 minutes in
pressure cooker.

In a large pot, water-fry 1 chopped onion, 1 chopped garlic head and 2
diced carrots. Then add the following:

 - 2 celery ribs, chopped
 - 2 potatoes, diced
 - 1 head savoy cabbage, chopped
 - 200g kale, chopped
 - 1 tin diced tomatoes
 - The cooked butter beans
 - 1 tsp chili flakes
 - 1 tsp rosemary
 - 4 bay leaves
 - 6 cups vegetable broth, or water and cube

Bring to a boil, then simmer for 45 minutes.

When serving, add 1 tsp nutritional yeast per bowl.
