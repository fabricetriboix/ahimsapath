In a large salad bowl, add the following:

 - 6 tbsp soya yogurt
 - 2 tbsp mustard
 - 2 tbsp vinegar
 - 1 tbsp lemon juice
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp ground black pepper

Mix well.

Peel one celeriac (about 500g), cut in big chunks and grate using a
food processor. Mix straight away with the sauce so that the celeriac
does not oxidises.
