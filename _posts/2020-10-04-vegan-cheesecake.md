Yes, you can have your vegan cheesecake and eat it! This is a "not
totally unhealthy" recipe for special occasions.

**For the crust**

In a food processor, put 1 cup dates and 1 cup walnuts. Process
coarsely.

Layer into 12 silicone muffin moulds and put in freezer for a while.

**For the filling:**

Soak 1.5 cup of cashew nuts in boiling water for 30'; drain.

Put in a blender:

 - The soaked cashew nuts
 - 1/3 cup lemon juice
 - 1/2 cup coconut milk
 - 1/4 cup maple syrup (or other healthy sweetener such as agave
   nectar or date syrup)

Blend until silky smooth.

**To make the cheesecakes:**

Take the moulds out of the freezer, and fill in with the filling.
Leave in the freezer for 4-6h. Set them out for 10' before eating.

Here are some options for different flavours:

 - Add blueberries on top for a blueberry cheesecake
 - Add 1 tsp vanilla extract to the filling for vanilla cheesecake
 - Add 2 tsp smooth peanut butter to the filling for peanut butter
   cheesecake (my favourite!)
