Soak 450g of split peas overnight.

The next day, drain the split peas and toss in a large pot. Add the
following to the pot:

 - 2 chopped onions (I'm lazy so I don't fry them)
 - 2 garlic head or the equivalent of frozen garlic
 - Frozen ginger
 - 3 medium potatoes, diced
 - Salt or vegetable cubes
 - 1 tsp chili powder
 - 3 tsp mild madras curry powder
 - 1 tsp turmeric
 - A large amount of water

Cook until the peas are soft.
