This Newari meal is super easy to cook, delicious and full of
goodness.

Soak a variety of beans the night before. For example, I use 1/2 cup
of each:

 - Red kidney beans
 - White chickpeas
 - Black chickpeas
 - Butter beans
 - Rosecoco beans
 - Mung beans
 - etc.

Choose about 8 variety of beans. You can even soak them for a little
longer and get them to sprout.

Tip the beans and soaking water in a pressure cooker with salt and
turmeric. Once cooked, **do not** discard the cooking water.

In a pan, toast 1 tsp cumin seeds and 2 tsp ajwain seeds for a couple
of minutes on high heat. Reduce to medium heat, add a sliced onion,
ginger, garlic and a bit of water. Cook for about 5'.

Then add 1 diced tomato and cook for a few minutes until the tomato is
cooked.

Pour the mixture over the beans and the cooking water. Add 1 tsp of
chili powder and 2 tsp of garam masala (or Madras curry powder). Cook
for a further 5-10 minutes on medium heat.

Garnish with chopped coriander (optional).

Eat with roti/chapati.
