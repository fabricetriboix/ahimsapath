Popular dessert conceived during WWII.

Ingredients:

 - 1/4 cup flour
 - 1/4 cup grated raw potato or fine oatmeal
 - 1 tablespoon margarine or butter
 - 1 finely grated carrot
 - 1/2 tablespoon jelly or molasses
 - 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
 - pinch of salt
 - 2 teaspoons grated citrus rind (optional)
 - soya milk (if available) or water to mix

Rub the fat into the flour to make a crumbly mixture. Add the potato
or oatmeal, baking soda and salt, and the citrus rind if you’re using
it. Mix well.

Add the jelly and carrot, and four tablespoons of heated milk or
water. After that, mix until smooth, put it in a well-greased bowl,
cover with foil and steam for an hour.

Serve with custard if you have it, or a spoonful of jelly or maple
syrup.
