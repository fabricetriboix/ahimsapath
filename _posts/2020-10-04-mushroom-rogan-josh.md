This is a mushroom recipe that took me a while to perfect.

Put 800g sliced mushrooms in a big pot and cook thoroughly. Cook until
the mushroom doesn't express any more water. Put aside.

Toast in a pot 1 tsp cumin seeds and 2 tsp fennel seeds for 2-3'.

Put 4 red onions in a food processor and process until the onions are
finely chopped. Add the chopped onions to the pot and water-fry on
medium heat for 10'.

Then add:

 - Juice of 1 lemon
 - 4 tsp ginger garlic paste
 - 4 tsp mild curry powder (I usually use mild Madras curry powder)
 - 1 tsp ground turmeric
 - 1/2 tsp chili powder (1 tsp if you want more spicy)
 - 1 tin of chopped tomatoes
 - 4 tsp scoops of peanut butter
 - 1 tsp salt

Cook for 10-15' on low-medium heat until the tomato is well cooked.

Mix the mushrooms and cook for a further 2'.

I typically eat this dish with chapatis.
