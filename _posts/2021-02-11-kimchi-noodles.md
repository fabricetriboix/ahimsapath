Now that you have your
[home-made kimchi]({% post_url 2021-02-11-kimchi %}), you might wonder
how to cook it? Here is a delicious recipe for you.

Cook 500g of wholemeal spaghetti and put aside.

Fry chopped onions and garlic in 1 tsp sesame oil for a few minutes in
a large pot.

Then add the following:

 - The kimchi (kimchi made from one cabbage head)
 - 1 tsp chili flakes
 - 3 tbsp soya sauce (yes, that's a lot of soya sauce, but it makes
   this dish really nice!)
 - 1 tbsp maple syrup (or other healthy sweetener)

Cook until the kimchi is cooked.

Then mix in the spaghetti and 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds.

Be forewarned: This recipe is **very** hot! It's outside the Nando's
ratings, for those who know Nando's.
