Peel the Jerusalem artichokes and slice them (or cut them in chunks,
whatever you prefer). Water fry them in a pot with:

 - Chopped or crushed garlic
 - A few bay leaves
 - 1 tsp provence herbs
 - Salt and pepper to taste
 - A bit of vinegar

After 5', add a bit of water, cover with a lid, reduce the heat and
cook for an additional 25'. Stir often and add water as necessary.
