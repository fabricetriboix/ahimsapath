These cookies just require two ingredients (yes, two!): 1 cup quick
oats and 2 ripe bananas (medium size). Mash the bananas in a big bowl
and mix the oats.

Make some cookies on a baking sheet (I use silicone mats, they are
really good).

Cook for 12-15' at 180C (with fan).

Variations for more flavours:

 - Add 1 tsp cinnamon
 - Add 0.5 cup chocolate chips
 - Add 0.5 cup raisins
 - Add a handful of hazelnuts
