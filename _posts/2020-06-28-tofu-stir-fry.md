Use an extra-firm block of tofu (usually around 440g). Wrap in a tea
towel and press with a heavy pan for 30 minutes. Put back in its
packaging, wrap with parchment paper and freeze overnight (or at least
6h); this will give the tofu a meatier texture. The next morning,
defrost at room temperature for a few hours, or in the microwave. Wrap
in a tea towel and press with a heavy pan again for another 30
minutes. Then break the tofu down with your hands in nugget-size
pieces.

In a big bowl, mix the following:
 - 3 tbsp tamarind sauce (or soy sauce)
 - 2 tbsp maple syrup
 - 1.5 tbsp rice vinegar
 - 1 tsp ginger-garlic paste
 - 1/2 tbsp toasted sesame oil

Then add the tofu pieces and mix well. Marinate for 30 to 60 minutes.

Stir fry the tofu pieces in a pan. When becoming dry, add the rest of
the marinade.
