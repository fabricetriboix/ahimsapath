Soak 1 cup of brown lentils overnight.

The next day, set out a frozen puff pastry to thaw.

Cook the lentils in a pressure cooker for 1 minute, then drain them.

Put in a pot:

 - The lentils
 - 1 carrot, diced
 - 2 tsp garlic powder
 - 2 tsp onion powder
 - 1 tsp paprika
 - 1 tsp sage
 - 1 tsp thyme
 - 1 tsp black pepper
 - 1/2 cup water
 - 1 cup frozen spinach
 - 1 oxo cube or equivalent

Cook until the carrots and spinach are cooked. The mixture should be
like a paste. If there is too much water, let it simmer until enough
water evaporate.

Pre-heat the over at 200C (with fan).

Toast 1/2 cup sunflower seeds in an air fryer for 2 minutes, then add
to the mixture. Also add 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs and mix. Then let
it cool completely (otherwise the puff pastry will start to cook when
filling it in).

Unroll the puff pastry. Place the mixture in its middle lengthwise.
Then fold the pastry tightly and seal the edges by pinching with your
fingers. Transfer the wellington on a silicone mat, seam down. Score
with a knife. Optionally, brush with a non-dairy milk to get a nice
golden colour.

Bake for about 30 minutes. Let it cool down for about 5 minutes before
serving. Serve with [cheesy roasted Brussels sprouts and baby
