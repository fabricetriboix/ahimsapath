Take 3 tbsp goji berries and soak them in warm water for 15 minutes,
then drain.

Pre-heat the oven at 180C (with fan).

Mix in a food processor:

 - The soaked goji berries
 - 1/2 cup walnuts
 - 1/2 cup dates
 - 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon

Process until coarsely mixed.

Take 4 large apples. I like Bramley apples, but that's up to you.
Remove the cores of the apples and fill the apples with the goji berry
mix. Place the apples in a tray and add some water around the apples.

Bake for about 1h. Top up the water around the apples if necessary.
