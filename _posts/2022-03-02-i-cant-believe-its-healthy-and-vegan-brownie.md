Everything is in the title, really! Those brownies taste and have the
texture of regular brownies. And they are super easy to make! The only
difficult part is handling the dough, which is very sticky...

Pre-heat the oven at 175C with fan.

In a food processor, toss the following:

 - 2 cups pitted dates
 - 1/2 cup atta flour
 - 1/3 cup cocoa powder
 - 1/2 cup peanut butter
 - 1/2 cup soya milk

Process until all the ingredients are incorporated.

Then add 1/2 cup walnut pieces and pulse a few times to ensure it's
incorporated. Don't mix too much or the walnut pieces will be broken
down in very small pieces.

Transfer to a greased mould (that's the difficult part) and bake for
15 minutes.

Enjoy!
