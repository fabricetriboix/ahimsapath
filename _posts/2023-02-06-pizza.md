Italian classic, vegan version and quite healthy too.

In a bread maker or dough mixer, add (in this order):

 - 230 mL of water
 - 1 tsp yeast
 - 1/2 tsp salt
 - 250g atta flour
 - 1 1/2 tsp vital wheat gluten

Let the machine mix the dough for about 3'. You may need to add a bit
of water or flour to get a good consistency. Put the dough in a large
glass bowl and cover with some cling film. Let the dough ferment for a
couple of days.

Pre-heat the oven at 180C with fan. Carefully take the dough out and
spread a generous amount of flour on it so it is covered with flour.
Take a large baking tray and sprinke some flour everywhere (this is so
the pizza won't stick to it). Then spread the dough thinly without
breaking it (this part takes a while and requires some care, unless
you're a pizzaiolo, which is definitely not my case). 

Mix the following in a bowl:

 - 2 tbsp tomato concentrate
 - 1 tsp oregano
 - 1/2 tsp salt
 - 1 tbsp water

Mix well and spread all over the pizza. Finally, add some toppings of
your choice, for example:

 - Sliced onions
 - Sliced chillis
 - Sliced mushrooms
 - Sliced capsicum
 - Sweetcorn
 - Olives
 - Vegan cheese
 - Anything else you would fancy

Bake for about 15', until the edge are slightly brown. Enjoy!
