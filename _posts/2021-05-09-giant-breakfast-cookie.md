 - 4 tsp raisins
 - 4 medium dates
 - 2 dried figs

 - 2 heaped tsp peanut butter
 - 1 medium ripe banana
 - 2 tbsp ground flaxseeds

Blend until smooth.

Stir in 1 tbsp chocolate chips, 1 tsbp sunflower seeds and 1 tbsp
pumpkin seeds. Pour in a baking dish (no need to grease it).

Top up with:

 - 1 tbsp sunflower seeds

Bake for about 40'. Let it cool for at least 20'. Eat directly from
