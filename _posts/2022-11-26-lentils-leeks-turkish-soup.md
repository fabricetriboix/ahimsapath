This soup tastes so good, it's hard to stop! Perfect in winter.

Soak 4 cups of red lentils for 1h and drain.

In a large pot, add the following:

 - 2 large leeks, sliced
 - The drained lentils
 - 2 onions roughly chopped
 - 2 carrots roughly chopped
 - 4 medium potatoes roughly chopped
 - 1 garlic head
 - 2 stock cubes
 - 1 tsp ground black pepper
 - 1 tsp ajwain seeds (or caraway seeds)
 - 1 tsp garlic powder (optional)
 - 1 tsp turmeric powder
 - 1 tsp paprika
 - 1 tsp chili powder
 - 1 tsp ground cumin
 - 1 tsp salt

Cover with water and bring to a boil. Then let it simmer for about
20', until all the ingredients are cooked.

Blend with a plunge blender. Serve with 2 tsp of nutritional yeast on
top of each bowl.

You can eat with toasted bread, and optionally stir in one or two tbsp
of soya yogurt to make it extra creamy.
