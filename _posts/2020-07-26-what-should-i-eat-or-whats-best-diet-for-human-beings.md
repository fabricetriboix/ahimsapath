If there is one area that is full of conflicting information, that's
nutrition. Even the science seems confusing as different studies come
to different conclusions. So which advice should you follow?

Cows eat grass, gorillas eats fruits and nuts, lions eat antelopes,
mongooses eat insects, blue whales eat krill, etc. Every animal has a
diet that is best for them, and the same is true for humans. The best
diet for humans is a whole food, plant-based diet. In fact, the
science is crystal clear on that point once you filtered out the
studies that are poorly designed or that are financed by corporate
interests.

I found that the cholesterol aspect is the most compelling evidence.
Cholesterol is used in our cell membranes to make them supple, and
that's why your skin is not like tree bark. So cholesterol is totally
indispensable for human life. So much so that our human body is able
to synthesize it, and to retain it and recycle it as much as possible.
The only dietary source of cholesterol is animal products (meat, eggs,
dairy products), and we can see that ingestion of dietary cholesterol
triggers atherosclerosis, which eventually leads to cardiovascular
diseases, such as heart failures and strokes (the number one killer in
the western world). A whole food, plant-based diet is the [only diet
proven to stop and reverse heart
disease](https://eatplant-based.com/only-diet-proven-to-reverse-heart-disease-plant-based-nutrition/), which thus shows that (A)
our human bodies do not expect to ingest cholesterol, and (B) the
ingestion of cholesterol is actually harmful to us.

On the other side, we have [vestigial
DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-gulonolactone_oxidase) related to
the synthesis of vitamin C, which shows that a long time ago, our
ancestors' bodies were synthesizing their own vitamin C. We lost this
ability during our evolution, most probably because we evolved to eat
foods providing enough vitamin C, such as fruits and vegetables.

Clear information is now available on the benefits of eating a whole
food, plant-based diet and the many harms of eating animal products. I
would recommend the following:
 - Forks over Knives: documentary (sometimes) available on Netflix, or
   [here](https://www.forksoverknives.com/the-film/)
 - How not to die, a book by Dr Michael Greger and Gene Stone
 - What the health: documentary (usually) available on Netflix
 - [Nutritionfacts.org](https://nutritionfacts.org/) is a non-profit
   website created by Dr Greger where he and his team scour
   western publications to present their findings in an
   accessible way
 - [Mic the vegan](https://micthevegan.com/) has some good,
   science-based, content on YouTube

For those of you athletes reading this, fear not the mythical deficit
in proteins or other nutrients you have been taught to ingest in vast
quantities! You can watch the Games Changers, another documentary
available on Netflix showing a variety of athletes who actually
improved their performance after switching to a whole food,
plant-based diets.

There are also tremendous advantages of a plant-based diets over an
omnivorous diet regarding animal welfare and environmental impact that
I will explore in another post.

Switching to a whole food, plant-based diet is hard, but the hardest
part of it in my experience is to open one's mind to the possibility
of living, and even striving, on such a diet. There are plenty of
resources online (and recipes on my website) to get started. If you
miss the taste of meat or dairy, there are vegan alternatives (but to
be honest and despite what vegan advocates say, they never really
taste the same as the original...)
