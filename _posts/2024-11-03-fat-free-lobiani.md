Quantities are for 4 lobianis.

Soak some red kidney beans overnight. Cook them in a pressure cooker
(add a few bay leaves to add a nice taste). Drain them and leave them
to dry a little bit in the open air.

Make the lobiani dough. Put in a bread machine or dough maker:

 - 320 mL water
 - 1 tsp yeast
 - 1 tsp sugar
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 500g atta flour
 - 3 tbsp vital wheat gluten

Adjust the water or flour to achieve the desired consistency.
Leave to rest for a few of hours so it increases in volume.

Dice two medium onion and water fry for 5-10 minutes.

Put in a food processor:

 - 500g of drained beans
 - The cooked onions
 - Salt and pepper to taste
 - 2 tsp Georgian spice mix

Process to obtain a paste. Don't process too much. Add a bit of bean
cooking water if necessary.

Pre-heat the oven at 250C (with fan).

Spread some semolina of your worktop. Cut the dough in 4 and flatten
them by hand. Put a quarter of the bean mixture in the centre of each.
Bring the edges together on the top and seal. Flatten each lobiani
again. They don't have to be too flat. Make a hole in the center of
each lobiani.

Bake for 7 minutes, then flip the lobianis upside down and bake for 3 more
minutes. The lobianis should be golden brown.
