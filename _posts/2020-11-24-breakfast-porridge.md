A tasty, hearty and quick breakfast, full of vitamins and minerals.

For 2 people:

 - 1 cup oats
 - 3 cups water
 - 2 tsp goji berries
 - 4 tsp raisins
 - 2 diced dried fig, diced
 - 4 large dates, diced
 - 1 tsp cinnamon
 - 2 tbsp ground flaxseeds
 - 2 tsp peanut butter (optional, but that makes it nice and creamy)

Top up with some berries of your choice; I usually use cherries, but
you can use raspberries, strawberries, etc. I usually use frozen
cherries that I first defreeze in the microwave (or take them out of
the freezer the day before).

Serve in two bowls and top up each bowl with the following:

 - 1 tbsp sunflower seeds
 - 1 tbsp pumpkin seeds
 - some fresh fruit of your choice; I usually use a banana

Enjoy!
