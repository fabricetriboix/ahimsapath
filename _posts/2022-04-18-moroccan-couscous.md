Traditionally, Moroccan couscous uses a lot of meat, but without the
meat it's just as delicious!

The night before, soak 1 cup of chickpeas in 4 cup of water.

Dice (in large chunks) the following:

 - 500g carrots
 - 500g turnips
 - 500g courgettes
 - Head of small savoy cabbage
 - 2 large onions

In a large pot, put all the following:

 - The chickpeas and their water
 - The diced veggies
 - 1/2 cup raisins
 - 1 tbsp ras el hanout (if you don't have, use Madras mild curry powder)
 - 1 tsp ground coriander
 - 1 tsp ground black pepper
 - Salt to taste

Bring to a boil, then let it simmer on low heat for about 30'. The
veggies should be well cooked but not disintegrating.

Prepare the couscous itself at the end. Put 1 cup of couscous
(wholemeal if possible, but it's very hard to find...) and 2 cups of
water in a pot. Bring to a boil, then cut off the heat and cover the
pot for 5 minutes. Finally, fluff up the couscous with a fork.

Serve and eat with harissa! The harissa makes a lot of difference in
the taste of the couscous.
