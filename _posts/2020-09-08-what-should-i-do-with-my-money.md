In the family I grew up, there was absolutely no talk about money.
Money was evil. Money was taboo. As a consequence, I started my adult
life without any idea of how I should handle money. When I started
working, I was quite happy with the idea that I would spend all my
salary and that as long as my account wasn't in red at the end of the
month, everything was fine.

I am very happy I matured a lot from those times, and I educated
myself in many ways on how to handle money. After 20 years, I can say
that these are the following rules in a nutshell:

 - Don't ever go into debt, except possibly to get a mortgage (or a
   student loan in **very** limited cases)
 - Keep your expenses low
 - Save as much as possible; half - yes half - of your monthly salary
   is a reasonable target

The one figure you should track like a hawk is your expenses. There
are many apps and websites that allow you to track and categorise your
expenses nowadays. I use Yolt, which is free and reasonably good at
its job, but you are free to use whatever fits your fancy. The
important is that you must know accurately where you are spending
money.

From there, your job is to lower your expenses and keep them low. I
have seen tons of motivational videos, personal finance blogs and
self-help books pushing forward the idea of the "latte effect", and
how much you actually miss by buying a Starbucks latte once a day.
Heck, I have even seen videos on YouTube about how you can use less
toilet paper and thus buy less of it! To me, these are insane advice
that will help you save very little with a guaranteed result: a life
of privation and misery. If you follow a weight-loss diet based on
restricting portion sizes, you will get hungry and miserable very
quickly, and in all likelihood you will stop following it at some
point. In the same way, saving pennies on the little pleasures of life
will make you miserable and much less likely to keep to it in the long
term.

To this I say "no". Sort your expense categories from highest to
lowest and start from the top. For most people, the largest expense
category will be housing (rent, mortgage, etc.) So that's where you
need to start. Find ways to lower that expense. Do you need that extra
room? Do you need to live in that expensive neighbourhood? What about
living in a Motorhome? By moving further way from London, I saved £325
on rent every month and got a bigger property. Now, that's good
savings! (BTW, I am not inconsistent, I did need that extra room :-p)
Then you move to the next expense category and so on. The goal is not
to deprive yourself of all the little things that make life more
pleasurable, but you just need to find cheaper ways to fulfil your
desires. To come back to the latte example, if you really do spend too
much on lattes? You might want to buy a latte-making machine and that
will save you some money in the long run.

The most important is to get out of the consumer mindset. A consumer
has a core (and often unconscious belief) that happiness can be
bought. "I need a big house to have more space". "I need a sports car
to impress other people". "I need my Starbucks mocha latte every
morning to wake me up". Maybe you need to go out in nature more, start
chess or basketball to boost your self-esteem or have a better sleep
hygiene.

There is a growing trend nowadays to recycle and reuse. Someone's
rubbish is another's treasure, as they say. You can find pre-owned,
perfectly good items on [Trash Nothing](https://trashnothing.com) (or
equivalent for your country), Facebook Market and dozens of other
websites and apps. You can use those instead of buying new.

The second figure you need to follow closely is your net worth. You
should (and I actually do it) maintain your own [balance
sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet) and [income
statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_statement). For your
balance sheet, write down all your assets first (properties,
investments, savings, pensions, etc.), then all your liabilities
(credit cards, mortgages, loans, etc.) By the way, if you own the
property you live in, add it to the assets. There is considerable
debate as to whether your family house is an asset. I consider it is
because you can sell it, realise its equity and live in a rental
accommodation. Conversely, if your house is in negative equity, try
convincing anyone that your house is not a liability! Anyway, subtract
your liabilities from your assets and you have your net worth. An
incredible amount of people have a negative net worth, which is an
absolute emergency that should be addressed immediately. Your goal
over time is to grow your net worth, because that's what you're going
to retire on. The higher your net worth, the sooner you can retire,
and the more enjoyable your retirement will be. There a whole movement
of people trying to retire early, sometimes in their thirties. A quick
search on internet will give you many results (eg: [Mr Money
Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) and [Early Retirement
Extreme](http://earlyretirementextreme.com/)).

Regarding liabilities, I think you should never go into debt except
for the following exceptions:

 - A mortgage (provided you buy a small and inexpensive property)
 - A credit card or two, provided the balance is repaid in full every
   month (having a credit card will help your credit score when you
   want a mortgage)
 - [Very tentatively] A student loan where advanced studies are
   strictly necessary for the job you want to do (i.e. doctor, civil
   engineer and other regulated professions that require a degree)

A student loan should be repaid as quickly as possible. Some argue
that a mortgage is not that big a deal and can be repaid slowly
because the rate of interest will usually be very low and money can be
invested instead of being used for additional mortgage payments. I
understand this argument, however:

 - The interest rates won't necessarily stay low; not too long ago,
   interest rates in the UK were [15% and
   more](https://www.mortgagestrategy.co.uk/analysis/historical-interest-rates-uk/);
   there is always the possibility that an economic shock will push up
   interest rates high in the future.
 - Your investments might go down in value and you might then think
   that bringing your mortgage down would have been a better use for
   that money.

Any other form of debt is totally unacceptable, including (but not limited to):

 - Car loan
 - Using debt to buy a smartphone, TV, clothes, holidays, etc.
 - Borrowing money from friends and family
 - A 24 months plan to pay your new smartphone as part of a mobile
   data plan (instead, buy the phone directly, ideally second hand)

You should save as much as possible from your salary. The self-help
industry has this mantra: "pay yourself first". I think it makes a lot
of sense. Carve a fixed chunk of your salary every month and invest
it. This method forces you to save and adapt. Whatever you saved
should be left alone to grow over time. Don't "dip" into your savings
to buy that fancy new iPhone 31. These savings should be ring-fenced
in your mind for your retirement only.

That's also why experts advise to keep a small fund for rainy days
that will allow you to cover your expenses for 3, 6 or 12 months in
case of emergency. I think first of all you should ensure you have
adequate insurance cover for various calamities that can happen to you
(illness, accident, and any other problem that can hamper your ability
to work). I think a rainy days fund that covers 3 months of expenses
is enough if you have some credit cards with unused balance and some
good insurance policies. Provided you have a real emergency (i.e.
something that prevent your income from coming, like an accident
putting you off work - and a 20% off deal of that brand new iPhone is
**not** an emergency), I would consider accruing some balance on those
credit cards acceptable, because that's unlikely you will run into any
such emergency in your lifetime. Also, building up 12 months worth of
expenses will takes years for some people and they might get
discouraged in the meantime.

Now the billion dollar question is: What should I do with the money I
carve out of my salary? The answer is obviously to invest it, but the
real question is: How? I do know a little bit about investing. I
actually tried different things, such as picking stocks, buy-to-let,
joint ventures... I even tried (unsuccessfully) to start my own
business! I also passed the
[CFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Financial_Analyst) level
one just to understand better the investment world. After 10 years of
various experiments, I can have a deep and honest look at my less than
stellar results, and humbly conclude that it's very hard to get
above-average returns. At the end of the day, even the vast majority
of professional investors will be beaten by the market over a long
period of time, so what chance do I have?

Now I recognise my lack of knowledge and expertise, and I decided to
fully embraced my averageness. I believe this has been the smartest
decision in my investing endeavours. I recommend the method suggested
by Lars Kroijer in his excellent book: Investing Demystified.
Essentially, he suggests that you invest in a worldwide index fund and
safe government bonds. The mix between the two will depend on your
risk tolerance and time horizon. And that's essentially what I am
doing now. I'm average and feel at peace about it because all the
research and science tells me that I took the right decision in terms
of risk vs rewards for my investments. Final words of advice: choose a
broker with low expenses and use tax shelters whenever possible.

There is a huge self-help industry predicated on the idea that you can
be successful by starting your own business, investing in penny
stocks, etc. I will redirect you to this [excellent blog
post](https://monevator.com/start-you-own-business-risks/) on
Monevator for the business idea. The truth is that we can't all be the
next Steve Jobs, Elon Musk or Warren Buffett. This is totally obvious
that we can't all be above average, and yet the self-help industry
wants you to believe that all you need is (1) the conviction that you
can do it and (2) to buy their kit that will reveal the mysterious
secrets for success. The truth is: being average in a country with an
advanced economy **is** success in itself. The self-help industry is
just after your money, because you will always fall short of the
promised success and just need that one more seminar, that final book
or that ultimate course.

If you really want to start a business, I believe what you absolutely
need is: (1) to fail fast (determine whether that business idea of
yours will work or not before engaging a significant amount of effort
and money), (2) to understand that you will be married with your
business 24/7 for the next 10 years, (3) to accept that your lifespan
and healthspan will be reduced by 5 to 10 years, and (4) a mentor. Of
all these, having a true mentor is the most important in my opinion.
Please be aware that the vast majority of people starting a business
will remain working like crazy in that same business until the
business ends or is sold.

In terms of stock-picking, here is a sobering sight:

![Berkshire vs Dow Jones](/assets/berkshire-vs-dow.png)

The performance of Berkshire Hathaway has been similar to the Dow
Jones over the past 10 years. So you can see that even Warren Buffett
is ending up average after all.

For my part, I am totally done with chasing returns and fortune. I am
happy to be average, get average returns for minimal risks, sleep
better at night and to have more time for myself and my family.

To know how much you need to save for retirement and how it will take,
I will redirect you to [this

And that's pretty much everything you need to know. Please feel free
to dig deeper into each subject if you want to, their is a wealth of
resources on the internet or in books.
