This vegan and healthy version tastes great! It actually is a tart,
but you can add a layer of pastry on top to make it into a pie if you
want.

First of all, you will need to make a batch of my [shortcrust
pastry]({% post_url 2020-12-25-shortcrust-pastry %}), and partially
bake it in a mould.

Peel, de-seed and dice a pumpkin or squash. This recipe will assume
450g of raw diced pumpkin (which is enough for one small pie); you
will need to adjust the quantities in this recipe if you have more or
less pumpkin. Bake the pumpkin chunks at 180C (with fan) for about
45', until you can easily squish them with a fork.

Toss the pumpkin dice in a smoothie blender and add the following:

 - 35 mL maple syrup
 - 60g brown sugar
 - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
 - 1/3 tsp ground nutmeg
 - 1 heaped tbsp wholemeal flour
 - 200 mL soya milk

Blend until smooth and pour into the pie. Bake at 160C (with fan) for
30 minutes. The filling should be set; it shouldn't wobble if you
shake the mould.

Enjoy!
