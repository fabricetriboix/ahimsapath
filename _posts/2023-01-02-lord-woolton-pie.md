Ingredients:

 - 1 1/2 lbs potatoes
 - 2 lbs of roots vegetables, cauliflower, pumpkin, etc.
 - cooked beans, about 2 cups

Dice all the veggies and put 1/2 lbs of diced potatoes aside. Put the
other veggies in a pot with:

 - 4 spring onions (chopped)
 - 2 tbsp oatmeal
 - 1 cube
 - 2 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp ground pepper
 - 1 tsp herbes de provence
 - 1 tbsp mustard
 - the cooked beans
 - water (just enough to cover the veggies)

Bring to a boil and them simmer for 10'. Drain and save the cooking
liquid. Simmer the cooking liquid to reduce and thicken it. Put the
veggies in a greased baking tin. Sprinkled with some chopped parsley.
Pour the tickened liquid over the top to act as a sauce.

Cook the remaining 1/2 lbs of potatoes. Add a bit of soya milk, 1/2
tsp salt and mash. Spread the mashed potatoes over the veggies. Bake
in moderate oven (about 150C with fan) until the curst is brown (about
40').
