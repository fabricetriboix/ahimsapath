This is a delicious and nutrition soup that can be eaten for breakfast
or meal. Mung beans are used a lot in Ayurvedic medicine.

Soak overnight 2 cups of mung beans in 8 cups of water.

Toast 1 tsp cumin seeds in a pressure cooker, then add some ginger and
garlic. Water fry for a little bit, then add the mung beans with the
water. Then add the following:

 - 1 tsp tumeric
 - 1 tsp chili powder
 - 1 tsp coriander powder
 - 2 tsp mild madras curry powder
 - 1 tsp chili flakes

Pressure cook for 3 minutes.

If you want to make it into a really healing potion, add some moringa
leaves and simmer for another 5 minutes.
