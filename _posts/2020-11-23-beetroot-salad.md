A healthy and tangy salad.

Toast 20g of almonds 1/2 tsp of cumin seeds for a couple of minutes.
Turn off the heat and let it cool on its own.

In a large bowl, add the following:

 - 2 medium beetroots, cook and peeled, diced
 - 1 diced apple
 - 1/2 red onion, sliced
 - Some herbs of your choice (I use 1 tsp tarragon)
 - 1 tbsp raisins

Add the toasted almonds and cumin seeds and stir well.

For the dressing, mix the following:

 - 150g vegan yogurt
 - 1 lime (or lemon if you don't have lime): zest and juice
 - 2 tsp honey (or other sweetener)

Pour the dressing just before serving.
