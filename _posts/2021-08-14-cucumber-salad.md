 - 1 1/2 pounds thinly sliced cucumber (about 3 medium cucumbers)

 - Black pepper, to taste

Instructions

Place the cashews, 1/3 cup of water, garlic, red wine vinegar, and 1/2
teaspoon of salt into the bowl of a food processor fitted with an
s-blade. Blend until smooth.

Place the cucumber slices, dill, onion and scallions into a large bowl.

Pour the dressing over the veggies and stir to coat. Add more water if
the dressing seems too thick.
