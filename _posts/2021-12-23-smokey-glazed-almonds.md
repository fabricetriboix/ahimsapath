Pre-heat the oven at 180C.

In a bowl, mix the following:

 - 1/3 cup sugar
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1/3 tsp white pepper
 - 1 tsp chili powder
 - 2 tsp smoked paprika
 - 1 tbsp garlic powder
 - 1/2 tsp ground cumin

Then add the following and mix:

 - 50g chickpea cooking water (or 2 tbsp water if you don't have)
 - 1 tsp sriracha sauce

Then add 500g almonds and mix well.

Spread the almonds on a baking tray (I usually cover it with a
silicone baking sheet to make my life easy) and roast in the oven at
180C for about 5 minutes. Then give the tray a shake and put it back
in the oven for 5 more minutes. Be careful and watch over the almonds,
they will go quickly from roasted to burnt.

Let the almonds cool completely before eating (so they are nice and
crunchy). If you want to store for later, use an air-tight container
so they stay crunchy.
