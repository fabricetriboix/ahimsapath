Most people believe they had happy childhoods, and yet in my
experience, most families are dysfunctional. The family environment we
grow up in represents the world when we are a child. This can have a
lifetime impact if we don't open our eyes. It doesn't matter whether
you are healthy, wealthy, in a great relationship, have plenty of
caring friends, be devoted and satisfied with your
religion/spirituality/philosophy and generally speaking have a
successful life, unresolved family of origin issues will weight down
on your life. And that's the reason why this is my first post, because
I believe this is the most important issue (or at least the first one)
you have to deal with in order to be happy.

**Disclaimer**: Some families are not dysfunctional, in which case you
might have little or no work to do. You might still benefit from
reading this post, though.

Unresolved family of origin issues will make you miserable because
they distort the way you look at life. In fact, your firm belief is
that your distorted vision is straight and true. Because those beliefs
have been taught to you (usually implicitly) since you were a baby, it
is nearly impossible to see reality in a different way than through
those beliefs. If you had friends and distant family members where the
dysfunctions didn't exist, that might help a little. But make no
mistake: it's what you lived every day that will be imprinted in your
mind.

If you have difficulties enjoying life, relational problems, or always
feel like something is pulling you down, you might well need to have a
look at your childhood and admit that maybe it wasn't such a happy
childhood after all. You might have ingrained beliefs you don't even
realise, such as "I have to please others", "I am worthy of love only
if I give/work/achieve/perform/etc.", "I am not good at anything", "I
am entitled to special treatments", "other people owe me", "no one can
be fully trusted", "it’s OK for other people to lose if I gain", "it’s
other people’s responsibility to make me happy and solve any problem
or annoyance in my life", etc.

I think it is difficult to overestimate the impact of your childhood
on the way you see the world right now. All that you take for granted,
your understanding of what is right and wrong, good and evil, your
beliefs, habits, defence mechanisms, the way you see friendships and
romantic relationships, your sense of self-worth, society and other
people who are different than you because of ethnicity, age, gender,
piercings, tattoos, qualifications, social status or the way they
dress or look like, the way you react to good or bad news, your
baseline happiness, whether you tend to trust people or not, etc. In
brief, everything about how you see the world is linked to your
childhood.

If you have some serious mental problems, or whether you just
experience frustration or sadness and wish that you were different or
that you see the world differently, you might need to deconstruct the
way you see the world and reconstruct it. For example, you might have
an intellectual understanding that, when seeing your friend's mum,
your own mum was treating you badly. That a good first step, but
that's not enough because the child in you deep down still sees it's
childhood as what is "normal". So in such a case, you would need to
deconstruct that core perception of reality, and reconstruct it based
on your intellectual understanding, values, external help, etc.

In order to initiate this process, you must first be able to see your
core beliefs and put them in question. Both of these steps are
incredibly hard to do. Everyone is different and will use a different
catalyst to initiate this process. In my case, it was my values and
sense of self-worth. Now the difficulty is: how can you be sure that
your core beliefs are indeed wrong and that what you want to become is
indeed right? This is where religion, spirituality, philosophy,
psychology and therapy come into play. You need an external reference
to validate the direction you want to tread.

I am essentially talking about changing your personality here. Some
core beliefs can be changed, but some can't and can only be managed.
Changing your personality in order to become the person you want to be
is possible, although extremely difficult. Letting go of existing core
beliefs will leave you with a sense of grief, insecurity and
confusion. In those circumstances, you will need to keep your eyes on
the goal of who you want to be and be extremely careful about outside
influences. Your friends and family, whether well-wishing or not, will
most probably try to put you back in your old self, mostly because
they are themselves insecure and uncomfortable with change. The most
important thing to keep during this whole process is the faith that
you will achieve this goal of transformation, trust in yourself, your
intuition and gut feelings, and the clarity of mind brought by
deliberate analysis of any "advice" offered to you, or emotions or
thoughts coming into your mind.

The most important point here is that you need to establish what are
your values first, using a cold, rational mind, and then force
yourself to live congruently to those values. It will most probably be
difficult and unnatural at first. Keep your values in mind and do what
your rational mind tell you is right. Eventually, you will reap
immense benefits. Final note: I would strongly suggest that you
include self-respect in your core values.
