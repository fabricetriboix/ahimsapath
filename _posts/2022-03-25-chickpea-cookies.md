Delicious and nutritious cookies, and very quick and easy to make as
usual.

Pre-heat the oven at 170C with fan.

Tip in a food processor:

 - 300g cooked chickpeas
 - 3/4 cup dates (pitted)
 - 1 apple (cored)
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract
 - 1/2 cup soya milk

Process for about 20 seconds, then add 1 cup hazelnuts and process
until smooth, then transfer into a large bowl and add:

 - 2/3 cup rolled oats
 - 2/3 cup dark cholocate chips
 - 1/3 cup desiccated coconut

Mix well, then put a bit of dough in a small mould (I use muffin
moulds) and press it down to make it compact. This is necessary
otherwise the cookies will be too crumbly.

Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the tray and bake for 10 more
minutes. Let them cool before eating. Enjoy!
